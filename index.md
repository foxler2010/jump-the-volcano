## What is this?

So you've stumbled across the site for my project, eh? How about I tell you a bit about it...

Jump The Volcano is a text adventure written in Java that is based around a simple turn-based system. The main premise is that you either jump over a volcano, or dumpster dive. It's a pretty obvious choice the first round, but as the game goes on, you amass a wealth of things allowing you to accomplish some pretty crazy feats.

Feats currently included are:

* Fighting monsters,

* Creating cyborgs to be your pets,

* Selling cans of beans for 5 cents a piece

AND MUCH MORE!

### History

The game was created by my brother who may or may not have had some help from his friends along the way. He introduced it to me as a fun thing to do when bored or as a conversation starter. "Jump the volcano, or dumpster dive?" he would say, narrating the game for me. I was learning Java some time later, and he did this to me during lunch. I quickly came up with the idea to code a "Jump The Volcano" game in Java to further my knowledge, and that's how the project came to be. There is still a lot to go before it is "production ready", but I believe anyone who enjoys following the small projects of ordinary people should stick around to see what this game becomes. I will undoubtedly update this page someday so stay tuned!
