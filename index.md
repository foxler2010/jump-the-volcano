## What is this?

So you've stumbled across the site for my project, eh? How about I tell you a bit about it...

Jump The Volcano is a text adventure written in Java that is based around a simple turn-based system. The main premise is that you either jump over a volcano, or dumpster dive. It's a pretty obvious choice the first round, but as the game goes on, you amass a wealth of things allowing you to accomplish some pretty crazy feats.

Feats currently included are:

- Fighting monsters,

- Creating cyborgs to be your pets,

- Selling cans of beans for 5 cents a piece

AND MUCH MORE!

### History

The game was created by my brother who may or may not have had some help from his friends along the way. He introduced it to me as a fun thing to do when bored or as a conversation starter. "Jump the volcano, or dumpster dive?" he would say, narrating the game for me. I was learning Java some time later, and he did this to me during lunch, starting a game with that opening line. I quickly came up with the idea to code a "Jump The Volcano" game in Java to further my knowledge, and that's how the project came to be. There is still a lot to go before it is "production ready", but I believe anyone who enjoys following the small projects of ordinary people should stick around to see what this game becomes. I will undoubtedly update this page someday so stay tuned!

## How to play

1. Get a Java 11 JDK (not JRE) set up. I recommend the `adoptopenjdk-11-hotspot` package from APT (for Ubuntu users), or any other Java 11 implementation you can find on the internet. The aforementioned package along with other Java resources is available at [adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net). NOTE: I have recently learned they are switching to adoptium.net, and becoming a project of the Eclipse Foundation. So far the APT repositories are still working, and you can access some instructions for enabling the repositories by clicking the installation link at the bottom of the page on [adoptopenjdk.net](https://adoptopenjdk.net). (Still, only for Ubuntu users, Windows and Mac do a different thing.)

2. Okay, step 2, you finished reading my rant on downloading Java. Now download the source code for Jump The Volcano into a folder you would like to put it in.

3. Compile the `top.drewssite.volcano package` using the `javac` command in a terminal. I'll let you figure out how to do that.

4. Make sure your folders look like this: `/folder-you-chose/jump-the-volcano/bin/top/drewssite/volcano/{Main.class + others}`.

5. Navigate to the /bin folder in your terminal and run the command: `java top.drewssite.volcano.Main`.

6. Follow the on-screen prompts to setup the game.

7. Have fun playing!

8. If you need to kill the program for any reason and can't use the in-game exit methods, just close out of the terminal and java will stop running.
