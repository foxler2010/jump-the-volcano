# Jump The Volcano

A simple Java text adventure all about jumping over a volcano.

## What is this?

So you've stumbled across the site for my project, eh? How about I tell you a bit about it...

Jump The Volcano is a text adventure written in Java that is based around a simple turn-based system. The main premise is that you either jump over a volcano, or dumpster dive. It's a pretty obvious choice the first round, but as the game goes on, you amass a wealth of things allowing you to accomplish some pretty crazy feats.

Feats currently included are:

- ~~Fighting monsters~~ (not done but there are some monsters included in the files, they are unused),

- ~~Creating cyborgs to be your pets~~ (not done),

- ~~Selling cans of beans for 5 cents a piece~~ (also not done but you can still get beans)

AND MUCH MORE! (that is true, you can do a lot of things)

## History

It wasn't me who came up with the idea for this.
I'll spare you the details, but it's been a long running thing between me and my brother to play this game using speech.
There is a "game master" who is the 'speaker' for the game and decides what items the player gets,
and there is the player who chooses what to do each turn.
The game master is like the randomizer in the code.
They get to choose all the items the player gets and what options they have each turn. It's a bit like an RPG. Or DnD. I dunno, believe what you want...

Now, some time ago I was talking to my brother about this game, and we thought that it would be amazing if this game was 'digitalized'. Me learning Java at the time, I thought it would be a good challenge to create this game from scratch using
zero libraries (for portability and to help me learn the basics). And that's how this project came to be.

## How to play

1. You need Java 11 installed because I haven't gotten around to building a binary of this game for all platforms. Compile the source and put it somewhere you want to keep it. It does not require any sort of installation on your system, just needs to be put somewhere where you can run it.

2. You run the Main.class file you just compiled and start playing. The rules are self-explanatory. You get options every turn and based on what you choose certain things happen. There is a lot of randomization involved so every game is different.

3. That's it. Have fun playing Jump The Volcano!

## Troubleshooting

First off, I can't give a lot of support if you are on Windows. I use Linux, and you should too, but I can live with it if you decide to continue using Windows for now. That being said, if you have problems that seem to pertain to the OS, you're going to have to debug them yourself. Feel free to make a patch to fix it and please send it to me so I can make a pull request of it. Just know that I won't do anything about your problem unless you  do the majority of the work to help me find the solution.

Also, on Mac, I cannot give a ton of support, but I might have some suggestions to help. But that's only because Mac is based off of Unix, and I like Unix. I really don't know much else about it so don't expect much from me. Like with Windows, feel free to make a patch and send it me, just don't expect any official compatibility updates from me.

Now, if it is not an OS problem, be sure you ran the command correctly. My setup for VS Code gives me a folder structure of this: /root-of-project/bin/top/drewssite/volcano/Main.class.
I navigate to the /bin/ folder (after compiling) in the CLI and run the command "java top.drewssite.volcano.Main". This is the
correct Java way of running a class file, so if you aren't sure if you are running it the right way, just mimic what I
described above.

This is a very new project and I have not yet gotten any support requests and so cannot make an FAQ. One will be added later once I get requests for support.
  
## Licensing

I don't care what you do with this game, just please mention Foxler2010 as the original author of it. If you would like to do anything that you think I might not like, or might violate the GPL, please contact me. I'm pretty open about licensing so odds are you can do whatever you want.

Unless it's a movie. I would like to be paid for that.

## Now go play

### No, seriously, please go play; I'm starving and need money from nonexistent ad-revenue to surive. Maybe someday I will add in some cool paid DLCs or whatever, for now it's free. Feel free to donate, though. I need mulah
