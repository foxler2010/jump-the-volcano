## What is this?

So you've stumbled across the site for my project, eh? How about I tell you a bit about it...

Jump The Volcano is a text adventure written in Java that is based around a simple turn-based system. The main premise is that you either jump over a volcano, or dumpster dive. It's a pretty obvious choice the first round, but as the game goes on, you amass a wealth of things allowing you to accomplish some pretty crazy feats.

Feats currently included are:

- Fighting monsters,

- Creating cyborgs to be your pets,

- Selling cans of beans for 5 cents a piece

AND MUCH MORE!

#### History

The game was created by my brother who may or may not have had some help from his friends along the way. He introduced it to me as a fun thing to do when bored or as a conversation starter. "Jump the volcano, or dumpster dive?" he would say, narrating the game for me. I was learning Java some time later, and he did this to me during lunch, starting a game with that opening line. I quickly came up with the idea to code a "Jump The Volcano" game in Java to further my knowledge, and that's how the project came to be. There is still a lot to go before it is "production ready", but I believe anyone who enjoys following the small projects of ordinary people should stick around to see what this game becomes. I will undoubtedly update this page someday so stay tuned!

## How to play

1. Get a Java 8 JDK set up. I recommend the `adoptopenjdk-8-hotspot` version, available at [adoptopenjdk.org](https://adoptopenjdk.org).

2. Download the source code into a folder you would like to put it in.

3. Compile the `top.drewssite.volcano package` using the `javac` command in a terminal.

4. Make sure your directories look like this: `/downloads/jump-the-volcano/bin/top/drewssite/volcano/Main.class`.

5. Navigate to the /bin folder in your terminal and run the command: `java top.drewssite.volcano.Main`.

6. Follow the on-screen prompts to setup the game.

7. Have fun playing!

8. If you need to kill the program for any reason and can't use the in-game exit methods, just close out of the terminal and java will stop running.
